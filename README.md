# Chrome_Dino_BOT
This is a Python script that plays the most famous offline game, the one you play when you open Google Chrome and you have no internet connection.

This implements the Genetic Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), which I personally find very fashinating.
Basically it memorize a certain ammount of "dinosaurs", the population. It let them run misuring their score, the fitness. When it has all the scores a new generation has to born! The worst ones are BRUTALLY KILLED while the best ones have space to reproduce themselves, the better they are the more they reproduce. Sometimes mutations occur. This step is made in a way such that the number of individuals in the population remains constant. 
The more generation you let run, the better they will perform.

When I'll have some days with no need for my PC or, way more likely, when I'll have another PC, I'll let them run ad libitum in order to see if they can beat the current world record filmed on YouTube, hopefully yes. 
(with one night of training it reach a score higher than what I can do by hands, almost 10000)
